# General Principles

## Introduction
The environment in which structural systems function gives rise to internal forces, deformations, material deterioration and other short-term or long-term effects in these systems. The causes of these effects are termed actions. The environment from which the actions originate can be of a natural
character, for example, snow, wind and earthquake. lt can also be associated with human activities such as living in a domestic house, working in a factory, etc.
The following concepts of actions are used in this document.

1. An action is an assembly of concentrated or distributed forces acting on the structure. This kind of action is also denoted by "load".
2. An action is the cause of imposed displacements or thermal effects in the structure. This kind of action is often denoted by "indirect action".
3. An action is an environmental influence which may cause changes with time in the material properties or in the dimensions of a structure.

Action descriptions are in most cases based on suitably simple mathematical models, describing the temporal, spatial and directional properties of the action across the structure. The choice of the level of richness of details is guided by a balance between the quality of the available or obtainable information and a reasonably accurate modelling of the action effect. The choice of the level of realism and accuracy in predicting the relevant action effects is, in time, guided by the sensitivity of the implied design decisions to variations of this level and the economical weight of these decisions.
Thus the same action phenomenon may give rise to several very different action models dependent on the effect and structure under investigation.

## Classifications

Loads can be classified according to a number of characteristics. With respect to the type of the loads, the following subdivision can be made:

- self weight of structures
- occupancy loads in buildings, e.g. loads from persons and equipment
- actions caused by industrial activities, e.g. silo loads
- actions caused by transport: traffic, liquids in pipelines, cranes, impact, etc.
- climatic actions, e.g. snow. wind, outdoor temperature etc.
- hydraulic actions, e.g. water and ground water pressures
- actions from soil or rock, including earth quake

This classification does not cover all possible actions hut most of the common types of actions can be included in one or more classes. Some of the classes belong as a whole either to uncontrollable actions or to controllable actions. Other actions may belong to both e.g. water pressure.

With respect to the variations in time the following classification can be made:

- **permanent** actions, whose variations in time around their mean is small and slow (e.g. self weight, earth pressure) or which monotonically a limiting value (C.g. prestressing, imposed deformation from construction processes, effects from temperature, shrinkage, creep or settlements)
- **variable actions**, whose variations in time are frequent and large (e.g. all actions caused by the use of the structure and by most of the external actions such as wind and snow)
- **exceptional actions**, whose magnitude can be considerable but whose probability of occurrence for a given structure is small related to the anticipated time of use. Frequently the duration is short (e.g. impact loads, explosions, earth and snow avalanches).

As far as the spatial fluctuations are concerned it is useful to distinguish between fixed and free
actions. **Fixed actions** have a given spatial intensity distribution over the structure. They are
completely defined if the intensity is specified in a particular point of the structure (e.g. earth or water
pressure). For **free actions** the spatial intensity distribution is variable (e.g. regular occupancy
loading, involved although they are variable actions.
